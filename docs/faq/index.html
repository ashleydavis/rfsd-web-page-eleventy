            <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<h2>Have a question that isn't covered here?</h2>
<p>Please email your questions to <a href="mailto:ashley@codecapers.com.au">ashley@codecapers.com.au</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I buy the book?</h2>
<p>You can join the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-feedback-driven-developer">early access program for The Feedback-Driven Developer</a>.</p>
<h2>What will I learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Building a complex product through a series of simple steps.</li>
<li>Creating a foundation, habits and development process that are geared for a rapid pace.</li>
<li>Techniques that produce reliable and valuable code.</li>
<li>Using live reload across the stack for fast feedback.</li>
<li>Capturing working code into version control (aka Git).</li>
<li>Automated testing to remove tedious manual testing and have a high level of confidence in your code.</li>
<li>Strategies for debugging, problem solving and growing your experience as a developer.</li>
<li>Using JavaScript/TypeScript across and beyond the stack, covering:
<ul>
<li>Backend with Node.js</li>
<li>Frontend (in the browser)</li>
<li>Deployment to production</li>
<li>Desktop applications with Electron</li>
<li>Mobile applications with Iconic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What do I need to know already before reading this book?</h2>
<p>This book doesn't teach JavaScript or TypeScript. You need to know enough to get the gist of the code samples in the book, but don't worry, I've made an effort to keep the example code as simple as I can. If you are coming from another programming language you should have no trouble picking up JavaScript/TypeScript as you read this book.</p>
<p>If you are also learning JavaScript/TypeScript as you read this book you'll probably be ok, provided you put in the work. <a href="../chapter-1/">Chapter 1</a> provides some resources for you to learn JavaScript.</p>
<p>Coming into this book you should know the basics of using the command line (the terminal) and a code editor of your choice (I recommend Visual Studio Code).</p>
<p>It will help if you also know the basics of using Git, but that's not completely necessary because we'll only use the simple commands and I explain them as we use them in the book.</p>
<h2>Why are you writing this book?</h2>
<p>I'm writing this book because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy writing and this is something that I can write about.</li>
<li>I want to help developers level up their skills.</li>
<li>I love coding and I want to teach what I have learned over the years.</li>
<li>I want to share effective habits that can make development not only tolerable, but also enjoyable and sustainable.</li>
<li>I want to show new and aspiring developers that it's not as hard as they might have thought - there's a process to it and anyone can follow the process and be successful (well, eventually... learning to code requires persistence and patience to learn, but anyone can do it).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not writing this book to earn a living. On my third book now I've realised it's very difficult to be a tech writer and make a living. So now I'm writing it for the enjoyment of writing and the satisfication of teaching.</p>
<p>But you know, if enough people buy it who knows? It might help fund my work on the next book.</p>
<h2>Why are you self-publishing this book?</h2>
<p>Because I can. I've had a good experience on my first two traditionally published books, but it's the right time for me to try branching out on my own.</p>
<p>When the book is finished, I may still approach a traditional publisher for distribution. We'll see how things go.</p>
<h2>What qualifies you to write this book?</h2>
<p>Three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>My +25 years of experience in software development;</li>
<li>My relentless search to find an efficient process for development that delivers working and valuable code; and</li>
<li>My experience writing books and coaching to help developers be more effective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What does the book cover?</h2>
<p>The book covers development of the open source Photosphere application, a fullstack application with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A backend on Node.js (a monolith)</li>
<li>A browser-based frontend</li>
<li>Production deployment</li>
<li>Desktop and mobile applications built with web technologies (Electron and Iconic)</li>
<li>An automated test suite</li>
</ul>
<p>The example application though is really only a delivery vehicle for learning the mindset, techniques and tools for fast development, with the main goal of producing reliable and valuable code.</p>
<p>See <a href="/outline">the published book outline</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>What language(s) does the book cover?</h2>
<p>The book covers JavaScript and later TypeScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript, because it's a very practical language, not too difficult to learn and it's the lowest common denominator for true fullstack coding.</p>
<p>Then TypeScript, because it helps us keep our code working through repeated evolution and refactoring.</p>
<h2>Will the book teach me JavaScript or TypeScript?</h2>
<p>No</p>
<p>The book is designed for developers who can already read JS/TS and get the gist of what's going on. If you are coming into JS/TS from another language you should have no problem reading the code.</p>
<p>I do provide links to external learning resources so that you can learn JavaScript/TypeScript at the same time as reading Rapid Fullstack Development.</p>
<h2>What is the &quot;early access program&quot;?</h2>
<p>This is the period of time when you can buy the book early while it's still in development.</p>
<p>This gives you a chance to buy the book at a discount, support the author and be involved in the book's development.</p>
<h2>How much is early access?</h2>
<p>Early access is currently set at the discounted price of $27 AUD (aprrox $18 USD). The discount reflects that there are still some revisions to be made.</p>
<h2>How much will the completed book be?</h2>
<p>The retail price for ebooks of this nature is around $30 USD.</p>
<h2>What do I get with the early access program?</h2>
<p>You get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discount to say thank you for being an earlier supporter.</li>
<li>The chapters currently released (e-formats: pdf and epub). <strong>NOTE:</strong> All chapters are now released, pending final revision.</li>
<li>Review drafts for new chapters in Google Docs.</li>
<li>New chapters as they are released (ebook format).</li>
<li>To work with the author, give feedback and influence the direction of the book.</li>
<li>A good feeling for supporting the author to write this self-published book ;)</li>
</ul>
<h2>If I buy the book in early access, will I later get the completed book?</h2>
<p>Yes, you will get new chapters as they are released and the entire ebook when it is finished.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> All chapters are now released, pending final revision.</p>
<h2>How many chapters will there be?</h2>
<p>There are 9 chapters now released.</p>
<h2>How often will new chapters be released?</h2>
<p>All 9 chapters are now released.</p>
<h2>When will the book be completed?</h2>
<p>The book should be completed in 2024, all chapters are now released so it just depends on how many revisions are needed.</p>
<h2>What formats are supported for the ebook?</h2>
<p>At the moment the book is released in pdf and epub formats.</p>
<h2>Will the book be printed?</h2>
<p>At some point in the future I hope to explore having a &quot;print on demand&quot; service.</p>
<p>So maybe. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<h2>If I buy the ebook, will I later get the printed book?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>However, if this book is ever printed (no promises), I would like to offer a discount on the printed book to buyers of the ebook, but we'll have to see in the future if that's financially viable. Sorry, I don't yet know anything about how to have this book printed and how much it might cost.</p>
