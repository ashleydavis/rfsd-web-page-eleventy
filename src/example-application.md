# The example application: <em>Photosphere</em>

The development of the application Photosphere is the covered in the book [Rapid Fullstack Development](https://rapidfullstackdevelopment.com).

Most of the book is very practical, showing you techniques, tools and process to become a more effective developer. I teach through numerous working code examples and you can follow along to fully immerse yourself in the development process.

Together we'll develop a complete working, and non-trivial, open source example application called Photosphere.

Photosphere is a photo backup and search tool. Initially we’ll be able to upload photos through a web portal and then browse them in the gallery. Toward the end of the book we’ll have a desktop and mobile application that can automatically find photos on our computer and phone and upload them for us.

### Version 1 of Photosphere is a simple fullstack monolithic application

Ultimately we'll go beyond fullstack and extend Photosphere to have a desktop application implemented with Electron and a mobile application implemented with Ionic/Capacitor. All frontends will share code and the same backend.

### Version 3 of Photosphere goes beyond fullstack

I'm building the Photosphere application as I write the book and I'm even livestreaming the coding ([see YouTube for recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrB0_KjTmHgIsiYYOzAUnH2aA5MtOewI)).
