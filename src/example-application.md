# The example application: <em>Photosphere</em>

## Covered in the book Rapid Fullstack Development

Good news. I've settled on the example application that we'll build in my new book Rapid Fullstack Development.

Most of the book will be very practical, showing you techniques, tools and process to become a more efficient developer. I'll be teaching through numerous working code examples and you can follow along to fully immerse yourself in the development process.

Together we'll develop a complete working, and non-trivial, open source example application called Photosphere.

Photosphere is a photo gallery and backup tool. Initially we’ll be able to upload photos through a web portal and then browse them in the gallery. Toward the end of the book we’ll have a desktop and mobile application that can automatically find photos on our computer and phone and upload them for us.

### Version 2 of Photosphere is upgraded to using microservices

Photosphere may seem too simple to require microservices, but trust me I’ll make a good case for it in chapter 4.

Even though I’ll give you some good reasons for the upgrade to microservices, the real reason to do this is simply so that I can demonstrate application of rapid development techniques to microservices (and you can skip this chapter if you aren't interested in microservices).

![Version 3 of Photosphere goes beyond fullstack](/assets/images/chapter-1/1_7-photosphere-example-app.png)
### Version 3 of Photosphere goes beyond fullstack

Ultimately we'll go beyond fullstack and extend Photosphere to have a desktop application implemented with Electron and a mobile application implemented with Ionic. All frontends will share the same backend. 

I'm building the Photosphere application as I write the book and I might even livestream the coding.
