## Have a question that isn't covered here?

Please email your questions to [ashley@codecapers.com.au](mailto:ashley@codecapers.com.au).

## Why are you writing this book?

I'm writing this book because:
- I enjoy writing and this is something that I can write about.
- I want to help developers level up their skills.
- I love coding and I want to teach what I have learned over the years. 
- I want to share effective habits that can make development not only tolerable, but also enjoyable and sustainable.
- I want to show new and aspiring developers that it's not as hard as they might have thought - there's a process to it and anyone can follow the process and be successful (well, eventually... learning to code requires persistence and patience to learn, but anyone can do it).

I'm not writing this book to earn a living. On my third book now I've realised it's very difficult be a tech writer and make a living. So now I'm writing it for the enjoyment of writing and the satisfication of teaching. But you know, if enough people buy it who knows? It might help fund my work on the next book.


## How often will new chapters be released?

New chapters will be released every 1-3 months. I'm working on this book in my spare time alongside multiple other projects. Sometimes new chapters will come out quickly, othertimes not as quickly.
