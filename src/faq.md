# Frequently asked questions

## Have a question that isn't covered here?

Please email your questions to [ashley@codecapers.com.au](mailto:ashley@codecapers.com.au).

## Can I pay with PayPal?

Yes

Send the money to ashley@codecapers.com.au and I'll email you the book.

## What will I learn?

- Building a complex product through a series of simple steps.
- Creating habits and a development process geared for a rapid pace.
- Techniques that produce reliable and valuable code.
- Using live reload across the stack for fast feedback.
- Capturing working code into version control (aka Git).
- Automated testing to remove tedious manual testing and have a high level of confidence in your code.
- Strategies for debugging, problem solving and growing your experience as a developer.
- Using JavaScript/TypeScript across and beyond the stack, covering:
  - Backend with Node.js
  - Frontend (in the browser)
  - Microservices (just the basics!)
  - Desktop applications with Electron
  - Mobile applications with Iconic

## What do I need to know already before reading this book?

This book doesn't teach JavaScript or TypeScript. You need to know enough to get the gist of the code samples in the book, but don't worry, I've made an effort to keep the example code as simple as I can. If you are coming from another programming language you should have no trouble picking up JavaScript/TypeScript as you read this book.

If you are also learning JavaScript/TypeScript as you read this book you'll probably be ok, provided you put in the work. [Chapter 1](https://rapidfullstackdevelopment.com/chapter-1) provides some resources for you to learn JavaScript.

Coming into this book you should know the basics of using the command line (the terminal) and a code editor of your choice (I recommend Visual Studio Code). 

It will help if you also know the basics of using Git, but that's not completely necessary because we'll only use the simple commands and I explain them as we use them in the book.

## Why are you writing this book?

I'm writing this book because:
- I enjoy writing and this is something that I can write about.
- I want to help developers level up their skills.
- I love coding and I want to teach what I have learned over the years. 
- I want to share effective habits that can make development not only tolerable, but also enjoyable and sustainable.
- I want to show new and aspiring developers that it's not as hard as they might have thought - there's a process to it and anyone can follow the process and be successful (well, eventually... learning to code requires persistence and patience to learn, but anyone can do it).

I'm not writing this book to earn a living. On my third book now I've realised it's very difficult to be a tech writer and make a living. So now I'm writing it for the enjoyment of writing and the satisfication of teaching. 

But you know, if enough people buy it who knows? It might help fund my work on the next book.

## Why are you self-publishing this book?

Because I can. I've had a good experience on my first two traditionally published books, but it's the right time for me to try branching out on my own.

When the book is finished, I may still approach a traditional publisher for distribution. We'll see how things go.

## What qualifies you to write this book?

Three things:
- My +25 years of experience in software development;
- My relentless search to find an efficient process for development that delivers working and valuable code; and
- My experience writing books and coaching to help developers be more effective.

## What does the book cover?

The book covers development of the open source [Photosphere application](/example-application), a fullstack application with the following components:
- A backend on Node.js (a monolith)
- A browser-based frontend
- Later, some basic microservices in the backend
- Desktop and mobile applications built with web technologies (Electron and Iconic)
- An automated test suite

The example application though is really only a delivery vehicle for learning the mindset, techniques and tools for fast development, with the main of producing reliable and valuable code.

See [the published book outline](/outline) for more details.

## What language(s) does the book cover?

The book definitely covers JavaScript: because it's a very practical language, not too difficult to learn and it's the lowest common denominator for true fullstack coding. 

Personally I use TypeScript, so I also want to cover TypeScript through the book, although I'm not yet sure the best way to make that possible. Currently I'm considering these options:
  - Adding a bonus chapter that argues how TypeScript can improve your development process; or
  - Later, issuing a separate TypeScript version of the book where all code is presented as TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

## Will the book teach me JavaScript or TypeScript?

No

The book is designed for developers who can already read JS/TS and get the gist of what's going on. If you are coming into JS/TS from another language you should have no problem reading the code.

I do provide links to external learning resources so that you can learn JavaScript/TypeScript at the same time as reading Rapid Fullstack Development.


## What is the "early access program"?

This is the period of time when you can buy the book early while it's still in development.

This gives you a chance to buy the book at a discount, support the author and be involved in the book's development.

## How much is early access?

Early access is set at $9 AUD (approx $6 USD). That's a massive 80% off the final price for getting onboard early in the book's development.

## How much will the completed book be?

The retail price for ebooks of this nature is around $30 USD.

## What do I get with the early access program?

You get:
- A massive 80% discount 
- The chapters currently released (ebook format)
- Review drafts for new chapters in Google Docs
- New chapters as they are released (ebook format)
- To work with the author, give feedback and influence the direction of the book
- A good feeling for supporting the author to write this self-published book ;)

## If I buy the book in early access, will I later get the completed book?

Yes, you will get new chapters as they are released and the entire ebook when it is finished.

## How many chapters will there be?

I've committed to 9 chapters. But currently it seems there is at least enough for 10 chapters, unless I can figure out how to squeeze it all back into 9 chapters.

I have various ideas and notes for bonus chapters, but I'm not committing to anything beyond 9 chapters at this point.

## How often will new chapters be released?

New chapters will be released every 1-3 months. I'm working on this book in my spare time alongside multiple other projects. 

Sometimes new chapters will come out quickly, othertimes not as quickly.

## When will the book be completed?

The book will be completed in 2023 or 2024. It's difficult to say because it depends on the other commitments and obligations I have at any point in time.

## What formats are supported for the ebook?

At the moment only pdf, but mobi and epub are planned for later.

## Will the book be printed?

At some point in the future I hope to explore having a "print on demand" service.

So maybe. We'll see how it goes.

## If I buy the ebook, will I later get the printed book?

No.

However, if this book is ever printed (no promises), I would like to offer a discount on the printed book to buyers of the ebook, but we'll have to see in the future if that's financially viable. Sorry, I don't yet know anything about how to have this book printed and how much it might cost.
